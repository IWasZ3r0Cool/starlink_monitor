# Starlink Monitor üåå

**Starlink Monitor** is a tool designed to independently gather data about your Starlink internet connectivity. It enables users to monitor key performance metrics and helps you better understand the reliability and performance of your Starlink connection.

## Features üöÄ

- **Ping Response Monitoring**: Measure and log ping response rates to check for latency consistency over time.
- **Site Reachability Tests**: Periodically check reachability of specific websites or IPs to assess connection stability.
- **Periodic Speed Tests**: Automate download and upload speed tests to track bandwidth performance.
- **Data Logging**: Store performance metrics locally for long-term analysis.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Configure monitoring intervals, test endpoints, and log formats to suit your needs.

## Installation üíª

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starlink-monitor.git
   cd starlink-monitor
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the monitor script to get started:
   ```bash
   python starlink_monitor.py
   ```

---

## Usage üîß

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python starlink_monitor.py
   ```

2. By default, the script will:
   - Measure ping responses to popular services (e.g., `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`).
   - Perform periodic speed tests at defined intervals.
   - Log results into a local file (`logs/starlink_monitor.log`).

3. Customize the configuration settings as needed (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

---

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Modify the configuration file `config.yaml` to customize monitoring settings. Examples of configurable options include:

- **Ping Test Targets**:
  ```yaml
  ping_targets:
    - "8.8.8.8"
    - "1.1.1.1"
    - "www.example.com"
  ```

- **Speed Test Intervals** (in seconds):
  ```yaml
  speed_test_interval: 3600  # Run speed tests every hour
  ```

- **Log File Directory**:
  ```yaml
  log_directory: "./logs"
  ```

---

## Roadmap üõ†Ô∏è

Planned enhancements to **Starlink Monitor**:
- Add support for visualizing data (graphs/charts for trends over time).
- Notification system for connectivity issues (e.g., email or push notifications).
- Integrate GPS metadata for mobility users (useful for RVs or boats).
- API or frontend to view real-time and historical stats.
